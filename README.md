# PowerShell Live Notifications

Notification Automation for PowerShell Live Streamers and Events.

This project seeks to rewrite the [TwitchStreamNotifications](https://github.com/powershelllive/TwitchStreamNotifcations) automation completely.
@markekraus wrote the original automation as a pet project to learn more about Azure Functions and C#.
As such, the project doesn't follow proper coding practices.
Most notably, the original project did not leverage Dependency Injection or separate projects and libraries.

In addition to bringing the project to higher code standards, Twitch updated its authentication on APIs.
This change broke the automation, and several attempts to fix it failed.
